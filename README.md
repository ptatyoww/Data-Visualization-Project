# Data Visualization Project

## Project Description
This R Shiny application provides an interactive visualization of the relationship between renewable energy installations in households and CO2 emissions across different states in Australia. The dashboard offers insights into how renewable energy installation in houshold impacts CO2 emissions on a state-wise basis, with a specific focus on yearly trends and variations.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this R Shiny dashboard is to visualize and analyze the impact of renewable energy installations in household on CO2 emissions across various states in Australia. This project was developed as part of the FIT5147 Data Visualization course at Monash University, aimed at enhancing my practical skills in creating interactive dashboards and understanding complex environmental data relationships.
